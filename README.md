## Introduction

Cloud Computing is an important technology that has leveraged innovation in different knowledge fields and economic sectors by providing distributed, scalable, manageable and fault-tolerant computing resources over the Internet. The large adopotion of Cloud computing services can be also explained by diverse reasons such as its pay-per-use charging model that enables cost reduction for customers, the rapid and automated allocation of resources that enable applications to quickly respond to bursts, and full-featured web and console interfaces that enable customers to configure hosted services easily.

The advances brought by Cloud Computing are backup up by academy and industry research and have increasingly attracted new researchers. There are different issues to be addressed that makes Cloud to be an active research field, including SLA fulfillment,  optimal VM placement and migration, cost reduction, power efficiency, hotspot detection, load balance, fault tolerance, anomalies detection, security enforcement, traffic and latency reduction and so on.

Considering the complexity of a Cloud infrastructure and the need to model proposed solutions and evaluate them in a quick, cheap and repeatable way, using a controlled environment that makes it easy to monitor and collect metrics, computer-based simulation is largely used to carry out research in this field.

Accordingly, this article presents CloudSim Plus, a new, full-featured, re-designed, highly extensible and modern Java 8 framework to enable modeling and simulation of Cloud Computing infrastructure, services, underlying mechanisms and algorithms. It is an open source project available at <http://cloudsimplus.org> and [Maven Central](http://cloudsimplus.org/docs/maven.html).

## Overview
CloudSim Plus is a simulation framework based on CloudSim 3, that went through an extensive re-design and re-engineering process to provide an updated, modern, more accurate, highly extensible, easier-to-use, maintanable  state-of-the-art framework improve several software engineering metrics such as [coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)), [cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science))
